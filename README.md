# My Personal Portfolio Website

🔗 Live Demo: pbain63.github.io/personal-site

Welcome to the digital corner of my creative world! This is my personal portfolio site — a handcrafted space where I showcase my work and connect with like-minded creatives, developers, and collaborators.

## About This Project

This website is more than just code and pixels — it's a reflection of who I am, what I do, and what I love to create. From interactive projects to design explorations, I’ve brought everything together here in one responsive, aesthetic, and intuitive experience.

Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow developer, or just someone curious about my work — I’m glad you’re here!

## Tech Behind the Magic

Built from scratch with care, curiosity, creativity, and lots of water (hydration matters!):

HTML5 – the structure

CSS3 – the style

## What You'll Find

- A sleek, responsive design (works beautifully on all devices)

- A portfolio section showcasing selected projects

- A little "About Me" — who I am and what I love to build

- A contact section — let’s collaborate!
